<h1><strong>The Covid-19 Detector</strong></h1>
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Coronaviruses are named for their appearance: Under the microscope, the viruses look like they are covered with pointed structures that surround them like a corona, or crown.</p>
<h2>Symptoms:</h2>
<p>The various symptoms of Covid-19 are:</p>
<h3>Common symptoms:</h3>
<ul>
<li>fever</li>
<li>tiredness</li>
<li>dry cough.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other symptoms:</h3>
<ul>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>aches and pains</li>
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risk Assessment for COVID-19</h2>
<p>Health-care provider (HCP) guidance outlines risk categories to determine work exclusion and monitoring procedures. After identifying risk category in the HCP guidance read the guidelines mentioned to determine quarantine measures and further use the self diagnosis (COVID-19 Detector) feature to predict your symptoms for the COVID-19. Following is the image provided by the CDC on the basis of which we have also implemented Risk Analysis on our platform.</p>

<h2>Self-Diagnosis of Covid-19</h2>
<p>Coming to the main part,&nbsp;our major objective is to develop a self diagnnostic system for Covid-19 Virus.&nbsp;A self-diagnosis COVID-19 detection model to help you self diagnose your symptoms. This self-diagnosis is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a medical professional for serious symptoms or emergencies.<br />If you believe you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty of breathing, call your doctor!</p>
<p>Following are the list of features taken as input from the users on the basis of which a person is classified as Corona Detected or Undetected.</p>
