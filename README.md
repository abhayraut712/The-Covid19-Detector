<p>The Covid-19 Detector</p>
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Coronaviruses are named for their appearance: Under the microscope, the viruses look like they are covered with pointed structures that surround them like a corona, or crown.</p>

<p>Common symptoms include:</p>

<h4>Risk Assessment for COVID-19</h4>
<p>Health-care provider (HCP) guidance outlines risk categories to determine work exclusion and monitoring procedures. After identifying risk category in the HCP guidance read the guidelines mentioned to determine quarantine measures and further use the self diagnosis (COVID-19 Detector) feature to predict your symptoms for the COVID-19. Following is the image provided by the CDC on the basis of which we have also implemented Risk Analysis on our platform.</p>
